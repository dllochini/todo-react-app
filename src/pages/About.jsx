      <p>
        This is a simple React application built to demonstrate basic routing
        using <strong>react-router-dom</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this project is to understand how navigation works in a
        single-page application without reloading the browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are focusing on clean structure, simple components, and easy-to-read
        code.
